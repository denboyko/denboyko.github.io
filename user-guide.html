            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
                Ailira answers tax related questions posed in natural language. You should speak to her just as you would speak to another tax practitioner. The more complex and specific the question is, the better the answer returned by Ailira. Just as "Tell me all about CGT and trusts" is a difficult question for a human, so too it is difficult for Ailira. Instead, try and think of the exact question you want answered and ask that. For example "If I remove a potential beneficiary of a discretionary family trust will that trigger a resettlement for the purposes of CGT?"
            </p>
            <p>
                In the past you might have tried a keyword search in Google or through the ATO website of "CGT potential beneficiary removal resettlement" and browsed through the results found. You might have to spend considerable time skim reading through unhelpful articles that merely contain those words many times!
            </p>
            <p>
                Ailira returns only those documents which are contextually related to the question posed - hence precluding and eliminating, any documents which are not pertinent to the question.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because of the specific nature of the data sources and the preciseness with which questions can be created, the results returned by Ailira are authoritative in nature and of greater value than the multitude of general answers returned by other research engines.
            </p>

            <h4>Asking Ailira simple Questions</h4>
