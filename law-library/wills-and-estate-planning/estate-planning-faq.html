            <h4>Who can be an executor?</h4>
            <p>
                Individuals, Public Trustee or trustee companies established by statute to act as executors may be an
                executor of an estate.
            </p>

            <h4>What should I consider when selecting an executor?</h4>
            <p>
                The choice of an executor is one of the most important decisions when making a will. When selecting an
                executor, you should consider the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Will your proposed executor accept the appointment?</li>
                <li>Is your executor likely to be alive and legally competent at your death?</li>
                <li>Is a familiarity with your family circumstances important?</li>
                <li>Is it preferable that the executor is independent of your family group or vice versa?</li>
                <li>Does your executor have the requisite skills that will allow them to manage your affairs after your
                    death?
                </li>
                <li>Should you appoint Public Trustee or a trustee company as an executor?</li>
                <li>Should you appoint a solicitor, accountant or some other professional person as an executor?</li>
                <li>Do you believe that your executor will act independently and impartially in the discharge of his or
                    her duties?
                </li>
                <li>Do you think that your executor will discharge his or her duties honestly and prudently?</li>
                <li>Should you appoint more than one primary executor?</li>
                <li>Should you appoint substitute executors in case one or both of your primary executors is unable or
                    unwilling to act as an executor?
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Who should I appoint as an executor? </h4>
            <p>
                It is far more usual than not for a spouse to be appointed as the sole executor in the first instance,
                although this situation changes the older people get, for obvious reasons.
                Apart from a spouse, who you may appoint as your executor depends on your personal circumstances and
                will vary from case to case. However, the following may assist you:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You will be more likely to appoint a family member the more:
                    <ul>
                        <li>that person is respected and trusted by you and, preferably but not essentially, your
                            (other) beneficiaries;
                        </li>
                        <li>competent that person is to perform the duties of an executor;</li>
                        <li>likely that person is to be alive or otherwise capable of acting as an executor at your
                            death;
                        </li>
                        <li>harmonious your family situation is;</li>
                        <li>uncomplicated and straightforward your estate is likely to be (noting that your executor(s)
                            can always obtain professional advice if and when required);
                        </li>
                        <li>unlikely it is that there will be a challenge against your estate.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    You might be more likely to choose Public Trustee/a trustee company over an individual if:
                    <ul>
                        <li>you have no family members, friend(s) or trusted advisor(s) who are suitable for the role;
                        </li>
                        <li>your family is likely to be divided over the administration of your estate;</li>
                        <li>your estate is relatively complicated (noting again that your executor(s) can always obtain
                            professional advice if and when required);
                        </li>
                        <li>the administration of your estate is likely to continue for a significant length of time
                            (if, for example, there are young children who are beneficiaries) and you are concerned that
                            your executor(s) may not live to complete the administration of your estate;
                        </li>
                        <li>you simply wish to have an independent entity administering your estate;</li>
                        <li>you are not concerned that the cost of administering your estate is likely to be greater.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Should I choose more than one executor?</h4>
            <p>
                One executor is all that is required by the Probate Court to obtain probate. However, willmakers often
                prefer to have more than one executor for their own reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
                The downside of choosing more than one executor is that, with more than one executor, there is the
                possibility of disputation, even stalemate, between those executors, the resolution of which may be time
                consuming and costly, in particular if a court order is required.
            </p>
            <p>
                A downside of choosing only one executor is that, should that executor be unable or unwilling to act at
                your death, there is no other person in place who can act. This difficulty can be overcome by choosing
                one primary executor and a secondary executor who will act only if the primary executor cannot or will
                not act.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some people feel uncomfortable appointing only one executor, particularly if that person is also a
                beneficiary, because they are concerned that that executor may favour themselves or others over other
                beneficiaries. If this concern exists, it is appropriate to ask whether this person should act as an
                executor in the first place. Having trust in your executor to do the right thing is critical.
                In any event, the executor is duty bound to act in the best interests of all beneficiaries. If an
                executor breaches those duties, he or she can be called to account for doing so.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having said that, if you have a self-managed superannuation fund, your executor may become the trustee
                of that fund on your death. If so, your executor may distribute assets from that fund directly to
                themselves, leading to them attaining a much larger share of your assets than other beneficiaries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Provided that the trust deed of the self-managed superannuation fund permits it, this difficulty can be
                overcome by you making a written binding nomination requiring the trustee of that fund to distribute
                your superannuation death benefits as you direct. Your sole executor would therefore, in this
                circumstance, have no discretion in this regard.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is also important to give consideration to assets in a family trust, which assets do not form part of
                a deceased estate. In this context, it is important to deal with the issues of who will be the trustee
                and appointor of that trust after your death. Specific provisions in the will can overcome concerns
                about a sole executor making decisions with respect to trust assets which may benefit them to the
                detriment of others.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, it is sometimes difficult to appoint only one executor when there are others who could
                equally be considered for that role. This happens most frequently with parents with more than one child,
                particularly in blended families.
            </p>
            <p>
                In summary, the default position should be to nominate only one primary executor and one substitute
                executor unless there is a good reason to appoint more than one primary or substitute executor. As to
                what constitutes a “good reason”, this is often a value judgement in each case. If the default position
                is to apply, consideration needs to be given to securing other assets, such as superannuation death
                benefits and assets in family trusts.
            </p>
