            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
                Ailira answers tax related questions posed in natural language. You should speak to her just as you
                would speak to another tax practitioner. The more complex and specific the question is, the better the
                answer returned by Ailira. Just as "Tell me all about CGT and trusts" is a difficult question for a
                human, so too it is difficult for Ailira. Instead, try and think of the exact question you want answered
                and ask that. For example "If I remove a potential beneficiary of a discretionary family trust will that
                trigger a resettlement for the purposes of CGT?"
            </p>
            <p>
                In the past you might have tried a keyword search in Google or through the ATO website of "CGT potential
                beneficiary removal resettlement" and browsed through the results found. You might have to spend
                considerable time skim reading through unhelpful articles that merely contain those words many times!
            </p>
            <p>
                Ailira returns only those documents which are contextually related to the question posed - hence
                precluding and eliminating, any documents which are not pertinent to the question.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because of the specific nature of the data sources and the preciseness with which questions can be
                created, the results returned by Ailira are authoritative in nature and of greater value than the
                multitude of general answers returned by other research engines.
            </p>

            <h4>Asking Ailira simple Questions</h4>
            <p>
                Ailira's core functions exist to enable complex natural language questions to be asked. However, looking
                for the tax legal dictionary meanings of words such as "trust" and "what are SMSFs", is still made
                possible.By using the "Chat" function or by entering your "simpler" questions into "Discover", Ailira
                will be able to come up with an answer that comes from a bank of question and answer (Q&A) pairs.
                However, for more complex questions we suggest taking advantage of the core functions of Ailira.
            </p>

            <h4>Asking Ailira complex questions</h4>
            <p>
                As seen above, questions such as "what is a trust?" can be answered quickly by Ailira. However, the
                function of interrogating the bank of Q&A operates in addressing complex questions as well as for simple
                questions. Here, user discretion is key in discerning from where the most appropriate answers can come.
                Therefore, a question such as, "If I remove a potential beneficiary of a discretionary family trust will
                that trigger a resettlement for the purposes of capital gains tax?", is a complex question which may
                return some direct answers from the Q&A pairs in accordance with her understanding of the question and
                the manner in which it was posed.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the returned Q&A answers may not be sufficient in addressing the entire question. Here, by
                using discretion based on a human understanding of the answer required. Ailira will best address your
                complex question through the results tiled below the direct answer, or by clicking on the "Inspect"
                option.
                Be sure to not only "inspect" the "hotspot" highlight, but also the surrounding text as some questions
                may be complex enough to require an answer which is more detailed and longer than that which can be
                contained in a single paragraph.
            </p>

            <h4>Filtering by Categories</h4>
            <p>
                Ailira has many databases that she can search through. Ailira content includes Legislation, Court Cases,
                Private Rulings, Rulings and Tax Topics and Commentary.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes, it is helpful to consider from which one of these sources the best answer can be derived
                which is relevant to the question you pose to Ailira.
                When you receive an answer that does not quite fully address your question, try to explore different
                "Categories". This will reduce the number of returned results and so focus on the information you are
                wishing to find.
            </p>

            <h4>Boosting your Results with Strategic Keywords</h4>
            <p>
                Ailira returns answers according to the elements posed within the question. Therefore it is imperative
                that the questions you ask include all the elements that you wish Ailira to consider. If you need to
                refine and focus the results to include additional elements or ideas, the "Boost" function will allow
                keyword(s) or phrases to be added to the original question to enable an answer that is in the true
                context requested by the "boosted" keyword(s) or phrase. The "Boost" function can be considered as an
                extra incremental layer, enriching the initial question that was formulated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here, the "Boost" function is not a simple keyword search. The meaning of the additional keyword(s) is
                understood according to the contextual meaning contained within the question. Therefore, by overlaying a
                "meaning" rather than a mere word, a more powerful search method is used. In addition to the content
                available to Ailira, this unique function in Ailira enables more dynamic, accurate and precise results
                than its competitors.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also use the Boost search as a place to start your discovery. Simply enter one or more keywords
                on the general topic that you want to know about into the Boost search. Ailira will then search her
                databases to come to a contextual understanding of those keywords and will then initiate a final search
                based on that understanding. This means that you should get a more relevant set of results, rather than
                merely every document that mentions those keywords. This is a great way to get a general understanding
                of a broad topic that you can then refine.
            </p>

            <h4>Finding better answers from a body of text</h4>
            <p>
                Having used the Keyword(s) "shotgun" approach, text from the possible answers can be used as follows to
                create a more complex question. AS you know, text within databases is worded in vastly different ways.
                The way you can pose a natural language can also be worded in vastly different ways. Should the question
                posed be worded so differently from the way the documents are worded, you may not come to an answer that
                directly answer your question every single time.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this point, you as a user, can find a body of text in any of the returned documents to run a search
                based off of that body of text. This body of text is selected simply by highlighting the phrases or
                sentences you believe have closely addressed your question and then clicking on "More like this Text".
            </p>

            <h4>Finding better answer from a displayed document</h4>
            <p>
                The "More like this Document" functions in a similar manner to the "More like this Text". When you find
                a document most closely addressed your question, click on the "More like this Document" button above the
                document. Ailira will then use this document to find similar documents that have similar content. From
                these additional returned documents, you will be able to find an answer that is closer to answering, or
                does correctly answer, your question.
